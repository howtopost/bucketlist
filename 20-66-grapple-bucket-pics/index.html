    <p>The mg20f mechanical grapple was designed to meet the needs of those rural lifestyle customers that want a loader grapple, but don’t have loader third function capabilities. The clamshell bucket is a specialized bucket that is essentially two buckets on a hinge. The loader comes with most hydraulic lines in place, so installation is a breeze and only takes common tools. The maximum lift height is 101.7 and can lift capacity up to 1205 lbs. A 66 bucket comes with the 2545c loader and it attaches to the front of the loader with a universal quick attach mount like most new tractors.</p>
